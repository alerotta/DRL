# 🧠 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementations of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms. These implementations are part of my self-study journey into reinforcement learning.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The initial implementations closely follow the examples from the book *[Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On](https://www.packtpub.com/product/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands-on-second-edition/9781838826994)* by **Max Lapan**. As such, they may appear very similar to the original code in the early stages.

---

## 📚 Purpose

- 🔍 Reinforce my understanding of **DRL** by implementing key algorithms from scratch.
- 🧪 Experiment with variations and enhancements over time.

---

## 🛠️ Structure

Each folder in this directory contains a different algorithm or project, often starting from:

- `dqn/` – Deep Q-Network
- `policy_gradient/` – Policy Gradient methods
- `a2c/` – Advantage Actor-Critic
- *(more to come as I learn and experiment)*

---

## 📌 Notes

- 🧪 This is a **learning-focused** repository – not all code is optimized or production-ready.
- 📦 Dependencies and requirements may vary between implementations.
- 📈 Over time, I may diverge more from the book’s code to explore original implementations.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- 📘 *Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On* by **Max Lapan** – a highly recommended, practical introduction to DRL.
